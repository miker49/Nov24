## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

R code to:

================================

Sure, I can help you with that! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step R script to
achieve your goals:

1.  **Read a set of files as characters**:
2.  **Split each file at a given phrase**:
3.  **Remove control characters like new line**:
4.  **Remove extra whitespace**:
5.  **Add a file name to each file**:
6.  **Count size at each step**:

``` r
# Load necessary libraries
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

# Function to process files
process_files <- function(file_paths, split_phrase) {
  results <- list(file_paths)
  
  for (file_path in file_paths) {
    # Read file as character
    content <- readLines(file_path, warn = FALSE)
    content <- paste(content, collapse = " ")
    
    # Split content at the given phrase
    
    parts <- str_split(content, split_phrase, simplify = TRUE)

# Wrangle data

    # Remove control characters like new line
    parts <- gsub("[\\r\\n]", " ", parts)
    
    # Remove extra whitespace
    parts <- str_squish(parts)
    
    # Add file name to each part
    file_name <- basename(file_path)
    parts <- paste("=====", file_name, parts, sep = ": ")
    
    # Count size at each step
    size_original <- paste0("nchar of original  ", nchar(content))
    size_split <- paste0("nchar of parts  ", nchar(parts))
    
    results[[file_name]] <- list(
      original_size = size_original,
      split_size = size_split,
      parts = parts
    )
  }
  
  return(results)
}

# Example usage
#file_paths <- list.files(path = "path/to/your/files", pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE)
file_paths <- list.files(path = wddata, pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE)
# above works

#split_phrase <- 
split_phrase <- "Leave a comment"

results <- process_files(file_paths, split_phrase)

# Print results
print(results)
```

### Explanation:

1.  **Reading Files**: The `readLines` function reads each file as a
    character vector, and `paste` combines lines into a single string.
2.  **Splitting Files**: The `str_split` function from the `stringr`
    package splits the content at the specified phrase.
3.  **Removing Control Characters**: The `gsub` function removes newline
    and carriage return characters.
4.  **Removing Extra Whitespace**: The `str_squish` function from the
    `stringr` package removes extra whitespace.
5.  **Adding File Name**: The `basename` function extracts the file
    name, which is then prepended to each part.
6.  **Counting Size**: The `nchar` function counts the number of
    characters at each step.

Feel free to adjust the paths and split phrase as needed. Let me know if
you have any questions or need further assistance!
